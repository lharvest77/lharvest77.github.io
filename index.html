            <h1>Liberian Harvest</h1>

            <p>
                Yaidoo Farm is a privately owned farm located in Margibi County, Liberia. 
                Since beginning operations in 2017, our primary focus continues to be rice
                farming. We grow a time tested  original traditional  Liberian variety (LAC 23) 
                exclusively. Our farming operation is strictly organic and Yaidoo Farm has been
                a source of employment to over 50 contract workers each years. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Our brown rice is sold under the brand name, "Liberian Harvest” in packages
                of 2.5 and 5 lbs. and can be purchased in all local supermarkets  in and around
                Monrovia. It’s bold taste, irresistible aroma, full body texture, rich color and 
                nutritional value had become the rice of choice for many Liberians and foreign national, 
                alike. Our rice is also gluten-free.
            </p>

                Food security is of the highest importance to ensure that our brand continues to rise to 
                the high standard which our customers have come to expect.     
            </p>

            <p>
                We have over the past four years been a consistent suppliers to our customers and meet
                their orders each and every time and on time.
